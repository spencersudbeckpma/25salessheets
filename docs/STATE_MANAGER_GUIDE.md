**What is a rollup?**
A rollup is the sum of your activity PLUS all your subordinates' activity.

**Example:**
- You logged 5 presentations
- Your 3 Regional Managers logged 10 total
- Their teams logged 85 total
- Your rollup = 5 + 10 + 85 = **100 presentations**

**Where to see rollups:**
- **Team View** → Click your name → See "Stats" card
- **Reports** → Select period → Download hierarchy report

**Time periods:**
- Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly
